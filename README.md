Backtabber

* hastytab backtabs round 7
* hastytab_r8 backtabs round 8
* arguments input through command line: first is location of data, last is file it should output to
* can speed up by running multiple instance simultaneously, just run it multiple times with the same output location
* round 8 backtabber needs and output of a round 7 backtabber to start
* sample inputs are given in output_800_5, which is a simulated WUDC with 800 teams
* apologies for likely-unidiomatic c++, I'm still learning
